--------------------fork----------------------------------------------------------
fork(): a linux system call that creates a new process in the current process
the current process will be called parent process and newly created process is called child process
after calling fork(), parent and child resume execution from the point just after the system call
the child process gets a unique id "pid"
fork() returns a value that you can use to program diffrenet bhvior between parent and child
fork() returns to the parent either the created child's PID or in cases of error it returns -1
fork() returns 0 to child process.

your memory is copied at child creatine
this means that variables and other resources are not shared between parent and child
1 way to rretrieve values from a child task is to read its exit status
this is not ideal as it is limited to a single byte value
see forke2 for example.

as the parent of a child you can wait for your child to finish
wait()
  parent waits til the next child process finishes
waitpid()
  parent waits til the particular child process finishes
wait(&status)
  provides a status pointer to wait() to get status
WAXITSTATUS(status)
  returns status value


system() = allows you to pass off command string to the bash command


ps = short for "process status" -> shows information about the current running process
    PID TTY          TIME CMD

rand() in C we use rand() and srand from the stdlibh to generate random numbers.
  srand((unsigned int) time(NULL));
  must provide a seed to the random number genrator
  there's no such thing as real random number
  there's a predetermined set of random number, and aa seed is provided as an offset to make sure one batch is not the same as another.

int randomNumber = (rand()%10+1)
